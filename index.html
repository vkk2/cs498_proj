			In professional sports, a salary cap is an agreement or rule that places a limit on the amount of money that a team can spend on players salaries. 
			It exists as a per player limit or a total limit for the team's roster, or both. Salary caps can be a big issue in negotiations between league 
			management and players unions because they limit players and teams ability to negotiate higher salaries even if a team is operating at significant profits.
