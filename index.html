			<b> NBA Salary Cap: </b>In professional sports, a salary cap is an agreement or rule that places a limit on the amount of money that a team can spend on players salaries. 
			It exists as a per player limit or a total limit for the team's roster, or both. Salary caps can be a big issue in negotiations between league 
			management and players unions because they limit players and teams ability to negotiate higher salaries even if a team is operating at significant profits. More info<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap" title="Salary Cap Wikipedia">here</a><br>
